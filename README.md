# webapp
In 2020, I took H2 Computing for a good 3 months. It went well until this web app project. I convinced my teachers to let me drop out (they were not happy about it). 

Fast forward to 2025, I'm done with my bachelors in computer science and embarking on my masters. still can't get this web app to work but I guess i will try.
